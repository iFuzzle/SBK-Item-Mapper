Fully AI generated tool (I wanted this Skript to prevent ArianaFan420 from having to map all the items by hand).
Based on the great findings of others.

# Setup 
Simply download BizHawk, open LUA Console, load the script.
Prepare a SaveState in Slot 1 right before hitting a blue or red box.

# Run
Make sure to set the correct memory address in the script that you want to map.
  local CURRENT_ITEM_ADDR = 0x122295 -- for blue
  local CURRENT_ITEM_ADDR = 0x12229 -- for red
Just unfreeze all memory addresses if you froze any (the script will set them for you).
Let it run and pick the generated .csv file

# Result
